# Refine

A theme for [Typora](https://typora.io). Optimised for easy reading and uses only preinstalled typefaces. Based on the styling for my [personal website](https://serena.nz/).

## Notable features

#### No embedded webfonts

For ultra-fast performance and the smallest footprint on your harddrive, this theme uses only preinstalled typefaces. This will mean that your theme might look different to the thumbnails, but it should still look beautiful nonetheless.

#### Varied heading styles

There is a range of display, serif, sans-serif, allcaps and smallcaps title styles for you to use.

#### Comfortable reading measure

Paragraph text sports a maximum width of about 80 characters.

#### Responsive styling

Headers, margins, text sizes and content positioning should all scale with the window, giving you the best reading and writing experience no matter what window size.

## Font stack

A few people have asked me what fonts you need installed to render the fonts displayed in the sample screenshots. The typefaces that you see are:

- [Questa and Questa Grande](https://fonts.adobe.com/foundries/the-questa-project)
- [SF Pro](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)
- [Athelas](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/athelas)


## Support

This theme should support all the usual elements. If you find that it doesn't support an element you use, please feel free to drop me a message or open an issue on this repo.

Happy reading and writing!
